# Assignment 4: API Love You - Oh CRUD

## Briefing

This week your assignment is to **leap into the world of server-side programming** with Node.js/Express.js. In this project, you will write server-side JavaScript to **create an API** that accepts AJAX request coming from a client-side web application (that you've built) to **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** data that are living on your server. 


## Requirements

### Part 1: Designing your API
* Similar to the previous weeks' assignments, you will start by designing your API on paper. You will be required to conceptually diagram how your requests and data will flow between your client and server. 

### Part 2: Development
* **Client Side**:
  * your client side code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) will be served through your web server.
  * You will use the `async/await` and the `fetch()` function to make network requests that allow your client to communicate with your server's API.
* **Server Side**:
  * Your client side code will be served through your web server by:
    * 1. creating a static file server middleware
    * 2. setting the default API route of your server to send the `index.html` file in your static file directory.
  * Your server-side code will use Express.js to define meaningful API routes that allow you to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE data on the server using http requests. You will use:
    * GET: `app.get()`
    * POST: `app.post()`
    * PUT: `app.put()`
    * DELETE: `app.delete()`

### Part 3: Deployment
Your website will be served using **Glitch** and will be pulled from a remote Github repository. You will need to practice good git tracking and connect your local git repository to a remote Github Repository.
