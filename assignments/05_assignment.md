# Assignment 5: The API of You: Living forever on the web

## Briefing

This week your assignment is to persist data in your Node.js/Express.js API with a database. You will write server-side JavaScript to do CRUD operations on a database, controlled by an API. Then, client-side JavaScript triggered by user actions will make API requests and read/write to the database.
