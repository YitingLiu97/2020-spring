## About

This week we will learn how to persist data in web applications using a database. We will learn about CRUD conventions for data storage and retrieval.

Emphasis this week will be understand the need for databases, rather than using a JSON data store, CRUD conventions, and connecting user events to API requests to database actions. 

### Outcomes & Goals

In this class we will be:
* Translating UI/UX designs into data models
* Learning the vocabulary of NoSQL databases
* Learning about Rest API/CRUD conventions
* Learning how to set and retrieve data from NeDB

Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of:
* Data Models
* NoSQL Databases
* CRUD
* How web applications consume custom, dynamic data

* **Data Models**
  * What is a data model?
  * How do you translate interface design into a data model?
* **NoSQL Database**
  * What is a document database?
  * What is a document?
  * What is an id/ObjectID?
  * What is a key-value pair?
  * What is a key-array pair?
  * What is a nested document?
  * How do you relate documents to each other?
  * What types of relationships can documents have?
* **Databases + CRUD**
  * How do you map data actions to API endpoints?
  * What are conventions, and what are choices that you, as the developer, need to make?
* **Deployment**
  * How do you use databases in a production web application?
  * What does it mean to responsibly store data?
  * What are ways that you can let users have control over their data?'

## What we are not covering
- Advanced databases (indexes, tree structures,join tables, etc.)

## Pacing / Duration
* :30 Homework/Review
* :20 Translating interfaces to JSON
* :30 Using a JSON file data store
* :5 Break
* :60 Using NeDB
* :5 Assignment

## Materials Needed

<!-- 
### Lecture
* Databases
  * Persisting data with a NoSQL database (as opposed to SQL databases like PostGres or SQLite)
    * NEDB
    * MongoDB
  * CRUD
* Deployment
  * Platform as a service (PaaS), virtual machines, 

### Studio
### Assignment
* Building on your previous assignment, add persistent data using a database.
* (Using templates?)
* Deploy to Heroku

## Exercises To Do Before Class
What materials (readings, tasks, exercises) should students complete before class to be prepared for the lesson.

## Essential Questions
- Why do we need databases?
- What are the different types of databases?
- How is the data in databases structured?
- In a document-based NoSQL database, what is a
  - document?
  - id? ObjectID? unique id?
  - schema?
  - collection?
- What does it mean to responsibly store data?
- What are ways that you can let users have control over their data?

## Introduction
Please provide a narrative of what the unit is about, and why we should learn it that is simple enough that a student could read and understand. Example: "In this workshop we will be using ... to explore ... so that you have a better understanding of how ...

### Outcomes & Goals
This can be easily answered by completing these example sentences:
* In this workshop we will be… (soldering, setting up a RPi home network, making a wearable that communicates with….)
* Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of…

## Topics
This section can have many subheaders (h3's). This should list all of the topic areas, (e.g. Git, Using the command line), with links to guides and references. 

### What we are not covering

NOTE: ...

Topics we are not covering, but are of importance:
* ...
* ...
* ...


## Pacing / Duration
Number of total hours the class session will take. Please try to take into account transition time between instruction and hands on exercises if any prep is necessary.

- Break down of the class schedule example: 
  - :15 Overview, context, examples and vocabulary 
  - :20 Instruction & hands on exercise 
  - :15 Wrap-up discussion & sharing, reflection or journal and next steps

## Materials Needed
What hardware, software, or other materials will students or teachers need for lessons.

### Vocabulary (example)
* Program: A procedure, or set of instructions, that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. 
* Programming Language: The human-readable commands and syntax (or grammar rules) used to write programs.

## Studio Exercise Descriptions
Descriptions of each exercise or phase of class. Similar to pacing but with more description of steps.
